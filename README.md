# Minishell

A mid-cursus level 42 school project requires us to create a shell similar to Bash, at least some parts of Bash. We must handle most characters, the ```|``` operator, environmental variable updating via the $ sign.

We also had to recreate certain built-ins such as ```env```, ```export```, ```cd``` and more.

## Bonus

The bonus part of the project required us to manage the ```&&```, ```||```, and ```()``` operators, so we had to implement recursion in our parsing.

## Toughs

It was our first big project and our first group project. We learned a lot about how Bash handles command line, the ```|``` operator, and environmental variables. We also learned a bit about termios.
