# Minishell

a mid cursus level 42 school project.

this project make use create a shell similare to bash, at least some part of bash, we muste handle most caractere, | operator, environnemental variable actualisation and acces via $ sign.

the bonus part make us manage && || and () so we had to implement recursion in our parsing.

My toughs on the project :

it was the first big project and the first group project, we learn a lot on how bash handle command line, | and environnementable variable, we also learn a bit about termios.

this project should compile on linux system.
