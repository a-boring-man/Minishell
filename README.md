# Minishell

A mid-cursus level 42 school project requires us to create a shell similar to Bash, at least some parts of Bash. We must handle most characters, the ```|``` operator, environmental variable updating via the $ sign.

We also had to recreate certain built-ins such as ```env```, ```export```, ```cd``` and more.

## Bonus

the bonus part make us manage && || and () so we had to implement recursion in our parsing.

My toughs on the project :

it was the first big project and the first group project, we learn a lot on how bash handle command line, | and environnementable variable, we also learn a bit about termios.

this project should compile on linux system.
